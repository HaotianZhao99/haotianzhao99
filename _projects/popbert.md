title: ðŸš§ PopBertï¼šUnveiling Populist Language in Political Discourse
description: In this project, I am learning and replicating the key steps in building the PopBERT model from the research "PopBERT. Detecting Populism and Its Host Ideologies in the German Bundestag" by Erhard et al. (2024). This study develops a transformer-based model to detect populist language in German parliamentary speeches, focusing on the moralizing references to "the virtuous people" and "the corrupt elite."
